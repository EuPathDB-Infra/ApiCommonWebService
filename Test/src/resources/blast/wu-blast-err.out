Notice:  this program and its default parameter settings are optimized to find
nearly identical sequences rapidly.  To identify weak protein similarities
encoded in nucleic acid, use BLASTX, TBLASTN or TBLASTX.

WARNING:  One or more instances of an invalid nucleotide code "l" have been
          encountered in the query sequence and are being skipped.

WARNING:  One or more instances of an invalid nucleotide code "f" have been
          encountered in the query sequence and are being skipped.

WARNING:  One or more instances of an invalid nucleotide code "j" have been
          encountered in the query sequence and are being skipped.

WARNING:  One or more instances of an invalid nucleotide code "i" have been
          encountered in the query sequence and are being skipped.

WARNING:  One or more instances of an invalid nucleotide code "e" have been
          encountered in the query sequence and are being skipped.

Query=  MySeq1
        (16 letters)

WARNING:  THE QUERY SEQUENCE APPEARS TO BE PROTEIN WHEN A NUCLEIC ACID
          SEQUENCE IS EXPECTED BY THIS PROGRAM (BLASTN).

WARNING:  the maximum achievable score of 5 in context 0 (frame +1) is less
          than the ungapped cutoff score S2 (=18).

WARNING:  the maximum achievable score of 5 in context 1 (frame -1) is less
          than the ungapped cutoff score S2 (=18).
